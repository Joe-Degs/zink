what i want is a tool to use to send files my many virtual machines.
I want to do this myself, and i want to make it work as expected. So maybe
a daemon running in the background on udp obviously that connects to peers and
keeps and can share files or other types of media between each other.

- i want files sent to be able to keep their state, permissions and all the
  other stuff should be kept same accross the various.

- so basically a daemon running on unixgram that handles sending the files and
  connecting to the other peers and all that. it accepts requests from

- a single computer can have as many peers as possible right.

- port to run is 60009 - 0xffff
