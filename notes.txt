How to handle Listening and transmitting data
----------------------------------------------
// im trying to look for a nice way to start listening on a network interface
// then also listen for interrupt signals and other stuff so i can shutdown
// gracefully.
// If a request comes through, i want to send it off to be handled by somebody.
// If a signal comes through i want it handled also. Requests are going to be
// json formatted. but the structure is what im still trying to work through
// right now

- fuck how do i do this now
